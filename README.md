# Data Driven Control for Time-Variant Systems

**This project is started at 09/2021, Authors: Wenjian Hao (AAE, PhD, Purdue University), Bowen Huang (PosDoc, PNNL (Current), EE, PhD, IOWA STATE)** <br />

__The goal of this project__ <br />
- *Optimal Control for time-variant systems using data driven method*

__Current Method__<br />
- *Data Driven Control with Machine learning*<br />

__3 Folders__<br />
- *Data Collecting*<br />
- *Deep Koopman Training and Optimal Control designing (Working on building our own private controller packages, casadi versions) [MPC, LQR, FiniteLQR, finished]*<br />
- *Plots for papers (Making it a private package)*<br />
