# Deep Koopman Representation for Nonlinear Time-varying Systems

**This project is started at 09/2021, Authors: Wenjian Hao (AAE, PhD, Purdue University), Bowen Huang (PosDoc, PNNL (Current), EE, PhD, IOWA STATE)** <br />

__Third Dependencies__ <br />
- *Numpy, Pytorch, Casadi,*

__The goal of this project__ <br />
- *Design the Optimal Controller for Nonlinear Time-varying systems*

__Current Method__<br />
- *Machine Learning and Koopman Operator*<br />

__2 Folders__<br />
- *Data Generating*<br />
- *Deep Koopman Training and Optimal Control designing (Working on building our own private controller packages, casadi versions) [MPC, LQR, FiniteLQR, finished]*<br />

__Things have achieved__<br />
- *Theorem 1: As the parameters of NN lifting go to the infinity, the K will converge (Done)*<br />
- *Theorem 2: Error Boundary (Done)*<br />

__Things to do__<br />
- *Add time weights during the training process*<br />
