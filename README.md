__Current Method__<br />
- *Data Driven Control with Machine learning*<br />

__3 Folders__<br />
- *Data Collecting*<br />
- *Deep Koopman Training and Optimal Control designing (Working on building our own private controller packages, casadi versions) [MPC, LQR, FiniteLQR, finished]*<br />
- *Plots for papers (Making it a private package)*<br />
