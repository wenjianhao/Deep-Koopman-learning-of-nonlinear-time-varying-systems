__The goal of this project__ <br />
- *Learn the dynamics of nonlinear time-varying systems (NTVS)*

__Method theory__<br />
- *Koopman Operator and deep learning*<br />

__2 Folders__<br />
- *Data Generating*<br />
- *Deep Koopman Training and Optimal Control designing <br/> (Working on building our own private controller packages, casadi versions) [Have finished {MPC, LQR, FiniteLQR}]*<br />

__Things have achieved__<br />
- *Theorem 1: As the parameters of NN lifting go to the infinity, the K will converge (Done)*<br />
- *Theorem 2: Error Boundary (Done)*<br />
- *Simulation for NTVS identification (Done)*<br />
- *Simulation for Cartpole with time-varying friction coefficient of the ground (Done)*<br />
